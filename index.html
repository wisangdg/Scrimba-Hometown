          <p class="instrument-sans">
            As Indonesia's bustling capital, Jakarta offers a dynamic blend of

            and colonial past. The city is home to iconic landmarks like the
            National Monument (Monas), a symbol of Indonesia's independence, and
            the historic district of Kota Tua, where Dutch colonial architecture
            still stands. Jakarta is also a hub for commerce, entertainment, and
            diverse culinary delights, offering visitors a chance to experience
            both Indonesia's urban vibrancy and historical significance.
